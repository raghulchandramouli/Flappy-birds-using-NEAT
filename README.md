# Flappy-birds-using-NEAT
"Built Flappy Bird game using NEAT. Trained AI with evolving neural networks for gameplay. NEAT's dynamic structure optimization led to proficient AI performance. Simulated natural selection for agent improvement



### Flappy Bird with NEAT
This project implements the classic game Flappy Bird using NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) for AI training.

# Overview
The goal is to train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird by evolving neural networks. NEAT allows for dynamic network structure changes, optimizing the agent's ability to navigate through the game.

# Features
NEAT integration for evolving neural networks.
Dynamic network topology adjustments for improved performance.
Simulation of natural selection to enhance agent proficiency.
# Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pygame library
NEAT-Python library
### Installation
Clone the repository.
Install the required libraries: pip install pygame neat-python.
### Usage
Run python main.py to start the game.
Press any key to make the bird jump.
Observe the AI agent's progress in subsequent generations.
### Project Structure
src/ contains the source code files.
config/ includes NEAT configuration settings.
assets/ stores game assets like images and sounds.
